This is a SQL Database Project for a Hospital Management System. It includes:

1. Database Design: Implementation of primary keys, foreign keys, a many-to-many relationship (if applicable, e.g., treatment records), and indexes to improve query performance.

2. Data Manipulation: Use of INSERT operations to populate tables, UPDATE statements to modify existing records, and DELETE commands for removing data, including both conditional deletions and table truncations.

3. Data Retrieval and Queries: Queries that utilise aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG; pagination using LIMIT and OFFSET; and data organisation through GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.

4. Table Joins: Examples of joining two tables, joining three related tables, and creating a database view that combines information from three tables.

5. Procedures/Functions/Triggers: Includes a SQL stored procedure, a SQL function, and a SQL trigger to automate system behaviour.
